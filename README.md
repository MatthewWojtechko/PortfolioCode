# PortfolioCode
A selection of my scripts from game projects I've worked on. These scipts are just small samples 
from several different projects - therefore they do not work together, and cannot achieve their 
purposes outside of the context of the Unity game engine and the scripts I had running with them. 
Isolated like this, though they do, however, show my programming style and capabilities.

Below is a list of what projects the files were from. Note that while they were created for 
specific games, they can and have been used for other projects.
